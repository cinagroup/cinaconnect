**Comprehensive build status:** See [HONEST_AUDIT_V3.md](./HONEST_AUDIT_V3.md) for the full honest assessment of what's built vs. planned.

**What this roadmap means:**  
- ✅ = **Built** — dist/ directory exists (1 package published to npm: `@cinacoin/core-sdk`)  
- 🚧 = Built + **deployed & live on Cloudflare Workers** (RPC Proxy, Keys Server)  
- ⬜ = scaffolding only, source needs to be written  
- 🔌 = SDK interface layer only — **requires external API key or service** to function

## Priority Next Steps

1. **Publish packages to npm** — all 64+ built, only core-sdk published so far
2. **Enable adapter exports** — uncomment ethers5/6, wagmi, solana, viem, siwe, eip5792 in core-sdk
3. **Demo real connections** — verify WalletModal connects to real MetaMask on all 6 demo pages
4. **Add tests** — 104+ test files exist; expand coverage for core functionality
5. **Honest docs** — this file and README reflect current built status
